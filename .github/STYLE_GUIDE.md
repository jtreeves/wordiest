# Style Guide

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and types
- Use camelCase for variables and function names
- Use PascalCase for class names, type names, and interface names
- Use uppercase snake case for constants
- No unused variables, unless it's a parameter, in which case prefix it with an underscore (e.g., `_index`)

## Formatting

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Do not use semicolons to terminate statements
- Do not use trailing commas
- Use arrow functions (`() => {}`) over traditional function expressions (`function() {}`)
- Use object shorthand when possible (`{ foo }` instead of `{ foo: foo }`)

## Modern JavaScript Practices

- Use ES of CommonJS modules; if CommonJS is required for a file, make its extension `.cjs`
- Use `import` and `export` for module imports and exports instead of `require`
- Use `async`/`await` instead of `.then` chaining
- Use `try`/`catch` blocks instead of `.catch` chaining
- Never use `var` in variable declarations
- Only use `let` in variable declarations if the variable's value will change
- Prefer array destructuring and object destructuring over manual property access
- Use template literals instead of concatenation for string interpolation
- Prefer `Array.prototype` methods (`map`, `filter`, etc.) over traditional loops unless use case requires a traditional loop
- Top-level functions should use function declarations, while inner functions should use arrow functions

## TypeScript Rules

- Prefer interfaces for defining object shapes
- Use type aliases for complex types or unions
- Reuse types and interfaces, especially in definitions of other types and interfaces, to keep code DRY
- Explicitly specify types in general instead of using type inference (e.g., `const name: string = 'Jackson'` instead of `const name = 'Jackson'`), including for certain React generics (e.g., `useState<string>('')` instead of `useState('')`)
- Always provide explicit return types for functions and methods, even if `void`; the full signature should be typed (inputs and output)
- Avoid using `any`
- Use `TS` and `TSX` files instead of `JS` files as frequently as possible
- In React components, use object destructuring (potentially in tandem with spread syntax) instead of a single `props` object for the parameters (e.g., `{ name, label, onChange }` instead of `props`)

## Code Structure

- Break down complex functions into smaller functions, each focusing on a single responsibility
- Isolate function into their own files
- Keep files short (goal of within 100 lines, but none should be longer than 500 lines)
- Use comments sparingly and prefer self-documenting code
